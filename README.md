# Learning-Data-Science
Random Notebooks from learning about data science and jupyter notebooks and stuff.

I'm basically just uploading notebooks where I had some input above any tutorial stuff. 

So far the notebook on Covid Cases in Ontario was all me, and you can clearly see the learning process from start to finish.

The Google_Locations notebook is currently a disaster, it's a pet project but i just don't have the skilll to understand how to plot the data points on a map. Also i didn't build the notebook. I had to replace basemap with cartopy and that's what I'm struggling with.
